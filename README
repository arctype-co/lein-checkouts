# lein-checkouts

This lein plugin performs one of the lein tasks (clean, deps, compile, jar, uberjar, install) on the current project and makes sure that the dependency projects 
which linked in the "checkouts" folder are built as well.


## Usage

Depending on the specified task different actions are performed on the depency projects.

- clean, deps, install: The task is executed for the project and its dependency projects.
- jar, uberjar: All dependency projects are "install"ed and the given task is executed on the current project.
