which linked in the "checkouts" folder are built as well.

## Usage

Depending on the specified task different actions are performed on the depency projects.

- clean, deps, install: The task is executed for the project and its dependency projects.
- jar, uberjar: All dependency projects are "install"ed and the given task is executed on the current project.
